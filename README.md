## Problem Statement üìù
Currently, Know Your Customer (KYC) is largely an offline and manual process or non-interactive online process. Create an online interactive process to do video KYC which is intuitive and self-sufficient. KYC should capture the user‚Äôs live photograph and their basic details like name, DOB, address, PAN card / Aadhaar, signature, income range, type of employment in a conversational manner.
